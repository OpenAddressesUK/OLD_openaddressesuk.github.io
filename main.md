At Open Addresses, we are bringing together information about the places where we live, work and go about our daily lives. By gathering information provided to us by people about their own addresses, and from open sources on the web, we are creating an open address list for the UK, available to everyone. 

Do you want to get involved by opening an address?

It’s as simple as entering it below.

Addresses are a vital part of the UK’s National Information Infrastructure. Open Addresses will be used by a whole range of individuals and organisations (academics, charities, public sector and private sector). By having accurate information about addresses, we'll all benefit from getting more of the things we want, and less of the things we don’t.

You can help build and maintain an address list for everyone through this platform.
