This document describes the Open Addresses solution for the *Alpha* stage, completed on **** November 2014. 

The description follows the flow of data processing from its third party Open Data or public data sources down through the final Open Addresses database. The same is also visualised in [this diagram](/assets/images/docs/data_workflow.png) for reference.

#<a name='sources'>Our sources of address data</a>

Open Addresses uses two types of Open Data or public domain sources:

- sources that are suitable to generate **reference data**, such as list of valid post towns or postcodes, and
- sources that are suitable to generate actual **addresses**. 

##Reference data
We use four different Open Data sources of reference data:

- [Ordnance Survey's "OS Locator"](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-locator.html), from which we source our reference table of **road names**.
- [Ordnance Survey's "Strategi"](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/strategi.html), from which we source our reference table of **settlements (localities)**.
- [Wikipedia's "List of post towns in the United Kingdom" article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_post_towns_in_the_United_Kingdom), from which we source our reference table of **post towns**, and
- The [Office for National Statistics' "ONS Postcode Directory (ONSPD)"](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/postcode-directories/-nspp-/index.html), from which we source our reference table of **postcodes**. Note that Northern Ireland's postcodes are dropped from the reference data as ["a separate licence for commercial use is required, direct from the Irish Land and Property Services"](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/licences/index.html). 

##Address data
For addresses data instead, the only source we used in Alpha is [Companies House's "Free Company Data Product"](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html). 

Our choice was driven by the need of obtaining the larger sets of addresses available through an Open Data licence or in the public domain, while at the same time being absolutely sure of being entitled to reuse them. Following our early research, Companies House's Free Company Data Product is the largest single source of address data that is not constrained for our kind of use and [we got confirmation that it does not include third party material](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/free_company_data_third_party_in).

Significant other candidate sources of addresses could not be used as they either:

1. **include** third party material that is not openly licensed, or 
2. **were improved** by using third party material that is not openly licensed (e.g. the validity of an address could have been checked using Royal Mail's PAF, that is a commercial product). 

A great example of this is [Land Registry's "Price Paid" data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads). Price Paid is licensed under the [Open Government Licence version 3](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) that, among the other things, does not cover "third party rights the Information Provider is not authorised to license and other intellectual property rights, including patents, trade marks, and design rights". We got [confirmation](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/price_paid_dataset_followup/new) through FOI that "Land Registry has been using Royal Mail (PAF) data to validate addresses between 1995 and 2000 and Ordnance Survey data sources since the start of computerised data capture/mapping processes in 2000 to the current day".

##Updating the data
Each of the sources described above are currently maintained and updated regularly by their respective publishers. It can happen, though, that they do not account for recent changes, such as new streets. During Beta instead we are planning to update the data on a daily basis, using every time the latest version available from any source we are allowed to use and we developed our software for.

It is important to note that, for Open Addresses' Alpha stage, we also decided to ignore addresses that cannot be matched against any of the reference tables. This approach will change during the Beta stage, when we will estimate programmatically the statistical confidence we can put in each single address and address component. This will allow us to publish addresses with a heterogeneous degree of trustworthiness, without the risk of confusing the user.

#<a name='etls'>The ETL software modules</a>

##The Common ETL
The reference data created from its sources described above by the software component we call *common ETL* (ETL as in "Extract, Transform, Load"). We consider the data highly reliable, hence it goes through minimal processing before being stored for Open Addresses' use. You are very welcome to study the [source code](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/common-ETL) to see the detail. 

##The Companies House ETL
The software component that is responsible of interpreting Companies House's data for use in Open Addresses is the *Companies House ETL*. The addresses are stored as "free text" in the source, so an important responsibility of the ETL is to decompose the addresses in their components and normalise each of the components vs the reference tables, wherever suitable. As described above, addresses that cannot be matched vs the reference tables are discarded. You are very welcome to study the [source code](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/common-ETL) to see the detail. 

#<a name='ingester'>The Ingester software module</a>
The Open Addresses solution is designed to support an etherogeneous, distributed set of ETL modules in the future, many of which may not necessarily be owned directly by Open Addresses but contributed and operated by other individuals or organisations, using alternative sources of data or means to produce the data first hand, e.g. through crowdsourcing.

The *Ingester* module - called internally "Ernest" in honour of Ernest Marples who was [postmaster general at the time of the introduction of postcodes in the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Marples) - is the interface between Open Addresses and this *ecosystem* of contributing ETLs. It provides a (soon to be) public API through which registered ETL modules will be able to submit addresses programmatically to our database of address submissions. Our own Companies House ETL module is run as if it was one of these third parties ETLs. 

During Beta we will publish instructions on how to run your own ETL and interface the Ingester. During Alpha, the Companies House ETL and the Open Addresses website itself (through the form on the homepage) are the only ETLs enabled to submit addresses to the Ingester. 

Data submitted through the Ingester is stored in what we call the "raw database". It's *raw* as we cannot make (yet) any general assumption on the quality of the addresses that are submitted to us, but just store them for later processing. The Ingester's database need to be effective at dealing with large volumes of loosely structured, incomplete and duplicate addresses submissions. 

It is also important for the Ingester to manage different submissions as if they were 'transactions'. This is useful, for example, in case we had concerns around any of the submission - e.g. their intellectual property - so that we can 'quarantine' that data while any necessary due diligence is performed.

You are welcome to review or contribute to the current version of the Ingester on GitHub [here](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/ernest).

#<a name='distiller'>The Distiller software module</a>
The Distiller module 'distills' the raw database into the best possible consistent set of addresses we can produce at the moment of execution. 

For Alpha, this means mainly identifying duplicates, e.g. this typically happens with the Companies House ETL if more companies are registered at the same addresses. 

In Beta the Distiller's role will become much more substantial, as it will detect misspellings and alternative spellings, manage contradicting sources for the same addresses, calculate rigorous statistical confidence in each address, possibly do cross-ETL inference (can we infer the existence of an address from the presumed existence of other addresses submitted by different ETL modules?), define the provenance record for the derived address data accordingly etc..

The Distiller is also responsible of creating unique identifiers for each unique component of all known addresses, so that they can be referenced in a linked data fashion and published accordingly, as described below.

You are welcome to review or contribute to the current version of the Distiller on GitHub [here](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/distiller).

#<a name='publishingapis'>The publishing APIs</a>
Open Addresses offers several APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to integrate our live data into your applications. During Alpha cover the following functionality:

- We publish each address component (street, locality, post town and postcode) and each address as URIs (unique resource identifiers) so that they can be easily referenced from third party applications. The URIs have the format *http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/[***AWAITING TEAM TO TELL ME***]*. Browsing any of these URIs using a conventional Web browser will offer you a human-readable Web page of the data describing that address or address component.
- You can search the Open Addresses database by querying *http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/[***AWAITING TEAM TO TELL ME***]*.

#<a name='downloadable'>The downloadable Open Addresses database</a>
Downloadable versions of the Open Addresses database are available, too. See the [download page](/download) for more detail. 

#<a name='provenance'>How provenance is documented</a>
Given the sensitiveness of the intellectual property matters surrounding address data in the UK, it is critical for Open Address to work fully in the open and to document in detail how our data is created or derived from its sources. 

[All of our source code is published on GitHub](https://github.com/openaddressesuk) and the data we publish is available for distribution in formats that include sufficient provenance information to fully assess its origin. It is our ambition to give anybody the means to reproduce all of our work, producing for their own the same data we publish.

The typical provenance information associated to each address for Alpha looks like in the JSON code below [****NOT FINAL FORMAT****]. It references the exact source code that was run and the data sources that were used, and when the data processing and the download took place. Whenever technically and legally feasible [we also store unmodified copies of the source data for reference and due diligence](http://download.openaddressesuk.org.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/?prefix=sources_archive/), e.g. the five files listed in the example.

We are evaluating adopting a recognised standard for documenting provenance in Beta, such as W3C's [PROV](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/).
