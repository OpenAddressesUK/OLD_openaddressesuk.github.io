Open Addresses is a platform that brings together data about the places we live, work and visit. We are creating an open address list for the UK, available for everyone.

Do you want to get involved by opening an address?

It’s as simple as sharing an address below.

Addresses are a vital part of the UK’s National Information Infrastructure. Open Addresses will help a whole range of organisations (academics, charities, civic hackers, public sector and private sector) deliver better services to people.

You can help build and maintain an address list for everyone through this platform.
