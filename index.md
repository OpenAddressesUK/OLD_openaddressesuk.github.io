At Open Addresses, we are bringing together information about the places where we live, work and go about our daily lives. By gathering information provided to us by people about their own addresses, and from open sources on the web, we are creating an open address list for the UK, available to everyone. 

Do you want to get involved by opening an address?

It’s as simple as sharing an address below.

##### Submission Guidelines

###### We do not want to receive any names in the submission, other than any company name that may form part of the address. The Open Addresses data that we publish will be about locations, not about people.

###### Please be sure not to violate others' intellectual property or privacy rights with your submission. If you think your Intellectual Property rights are being infringed then please [email](mailto:team@openaddressesuk.org) us describing the data that you believe is affected.

###### When you submit an address we will capture some additional information: specifically the IP address that you are currently using. This information is used to track submissions and as part of our processes to track provenance and to remove any data that is unlawful. Find out more about our privacy policy [here](/about/data/privacy).

###### By submitting an address you are saying that Open Addresses Limited can re-use the address and publish it under an open data licence. You are saying that the publication of the address by Open Addresses Limited or third parties does not and will not infringe any of your legal rights or those of any third party. 


Addresses are a vital part of the UK’s National Information Infrastructure. Open Addresses will be used by a whole range of individuals and organisations (academics, charities, public sector and private sector). By having accurate information about addresses, we'll all benefit from getting more of the things we want, and less of the things we don’t.

You can help build and maintain an address list for everyone through this platform.
