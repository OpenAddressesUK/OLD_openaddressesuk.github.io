Well it’s been a busy couple of months since the Open Addresses Symposium on 8 August 2014. As well as securing funding for the Alpha and Beta phases that will see us through to the end of March 2014 the team have been busy on a whole host of differing things:

<li>Legal: using data that has been cleansed using the Postcode Address File (PAF) or AddressBase may infringe Royal Mail or Ordnance Survey intellectual property (IP) rights. We do not want to infringe any IP so we’ve been defining rules to check how cleansing has occurred and to track provenance through the process.</li>
<li>Technical: inference over existing open data sources can provide a good starting point for an address database. We have built initial versions of some technology to do this.</li>
<li>Business: we identified customers that are not well addressed by current products, and are exploring revenue generation options such as sponsorship, white labeling, and paid-for levels of service.</li>
<li>Data: we performed due diligence on four prospective open datasets to seed the database (from Companies House, Land Registry, VOA and NROSH) and found only Companies House data was definitely untainted with third-party IP.</li>

The Alpha phase completes at the end of November 2014. By then we will provide an open gazetteer of regions, localities and streets; and a page per known address. 

During this phase we will also continue to expand on each of the four streams above (legal, technical, business and data) as well as looking for people to help identify and perform due diligence on other open datasets that contain addresses.
