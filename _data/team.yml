  bio: Trained as an economist, I spent the first 20 years of my working life in building materials before stumbling upon GIS. A chance conversation led to me becoming General Manager of GDC and Head of Professional Services at whereonearth.com during the wackiest part of the dot com boom and bust. In 2002 some colleagues and I bought out GDC with investment support from nearly all of the employees. 4 years later GDC had grown to be one of the leading suppliers of e-Government solutions and corporate GI to Local Government with a strong reputation for innovation and customer service. MapInfo bought the business in 2007. After working for MapInfo for 18 months as UK MD and Director of Product and Industry Strategy, EMEA I branched out to look for the next big thing. Through my consultancy KnowWhere, I work as a non-executive director, a strategic consultant and an investor, advisor and mentor to technology startups. I am currently chairman of geo.me, a Google Maps Partner and chairman of Exprodat Consultingwhich provides geo-services to the oil and gas industry and a strategic advisor to the board of Astun Technology, the UK's leading Open Source geobusiness and a member of the Advisory Board of OpenCage Data. I am also a Special Lecturer at the School of Geography at the University of Nottingham. I helped to start the OSM-GB project and am part of the Taarifa team. I was chair of the LOC for FOSS4G 2013 in Nottingham in September 2013. When not working, I blog, twitter, talk about geography, technology, things open and politics and follow the Arsenal

  bio: Andy Hird is Managing Director of Aligned Assets Limited who are the UKâ€™s largest independent Address Management and gazetteer solution providers.  He received a BA Geography in 1997 at Middlesex University and after graduation began his career in GIS at Guildford Borough Council.  After 5 successive job promotions in as many years at the Local Authority, and feeling that a new challenge was needed, Andy joined Aligned Assets as Professional Services Manager. From 2003 to 2012 Andy worked closely with a number of Local Authorities in implementing, developing and enhancing their Local Land & Property Gazetteers.  During this period Andy faced most (if not all) of the problems associated with building a centralised address database and ways in which those problems could be resolved. In 2012, Andy was appointed Managing Director of Aligned Assets, and since that time has overseen significant company growth. Throughout his 11-year tenure with Aligned Assets, Andy has built a reputation for delivering exceptional customer service, developing successful business strategies and placing Aligned Assets at the forefront of Address Management solutions for Local Authorities and Emergency Services.  Having lived and breathed address management throughout his career, Andy is passionate about making his knowledge and skills available to the Open Addresses project. In addition to Managing a company, Andy is an avid VW enthusiast and late night developer, though the developers at his company often prefer it when he sticks to Business Plans & Strategic relationships!
