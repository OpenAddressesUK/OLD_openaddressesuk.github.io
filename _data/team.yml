  bio: Andy Hird is Managing Director of Aligned Assets Limited, the UK’s largest independent Address Management and gazetteer solution providers. He received a BA Geography in 1997 at Middlesex University and after graduation began his career in GIS at Guildford Borough Council. After five successive job promotions in as many years at the Local Authority, and feeling that a new challenge was needed, Andy joined Aligned Assets as Professional Services Manager. From 2003 to 2012 Andy worked closely with a number of Local Authorities in implementing, developing and enhancing their Local Land & Property Gazetteers. During this period Andy faced most (if not all) of the problems associated with building a centralised address database and ways in which those problems could be resolved. In 2012, Andy was appointed Managing Director of Aligned Assets, and since that time has overseen significant company growth. Throughout his 11-year tenure with Aligned Assets, Andy has built a reputation for delivering exceptional customer service, developing successful business strategies and placing Aligned Assets at the forefront of Address Management solutions for Local Authorities and Emergency Services. Having lived and breathed address management throughout his career, Andy is passionate about making his knowledge and skills available to the Open Addresses project.
