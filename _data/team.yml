    Within the wider UK public sector, Jeni worked on the early linked data work on data.gov.uk, helping to engineer new standards for the publication of statistics as linked data; building APIs for geographic, transport and education data; and supporting the publication of public sector organograms as open data. She continues her work within the UK’s public sector as a member of the UK Government Linked Data Group, the Open Data User Group, the Crime and Justice Transparency Sector Panel and the Open Standards Board.

She was appointed by Tim Berners-Lee to the W3C’s Technical Architecture Group in 2011 and has since chaired the W3C’s HTML Data Task Force.

  bio: Prior to joining Open Addresses Limited, Peter spent over 20 years in the telecommunications industry working at the intersection of technology, business and people. After gaining a BA in Mathematics from Oxford University Peter's first job was in Lancashire where he worked for a predecessor of Virgin Media despatching technicians to people’s houses to fix faults with people's telephones. He kept asking questions, such as why the fault existed or why people sometimes went to the wrong house, so they moved him into the IT department to help make things better. After 5 years helping make things better Peter moved to a software company, Convergys Limited, where he helped multiple European telecoms companies use network inventory software to launch new telephone, television and internet services. After leaving Convergys Peter spent 10 years at a professional services firm, Cartesian, where he worked with telecommunications companies, software companies and regulators to investigate new technologies, transform businesses and launch new products in his role of Director of Sales Support and Innovation. Over the last year Peter has been working in a voluntary role to organise an independent review of digital government policy for the Labour Party. When he is neither working or volunteering Peter reads a lot of books and watches Blackpool FC.
