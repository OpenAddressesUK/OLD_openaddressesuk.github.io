Open Addresses is a platform that brings together data about the places we live, work and visit. We are creating an open address list for the UK, available for everyone.

Addresses are a vital part of the UKâ€™s National Information Infrastructure. Open Addresses will help a whole range of organisations (academics, charities, civic hackers, public sector and private sector) deliver better services to people.

You can help build and maintain this address list through the platform. [Why not submit your address now](link here)?
