Question: You state that you are exploring revenue generation options. Will the Open Address file really be open data?

Answer: The Open Address file will always be available in full, for free, as open data.

Question: Does the Open Address file create a new privacy risk?

Answer: No. We will only be capturing and storing addresses. The addresses where people live are already available through other closed address products. No names, other than those company names that form part of the address, will be associated with addresses.

Question: What happens if some other party creates an equivalent open, free product?

Answer: If a comparable product is released with a commitment that it will remain free, definitive and open then we would regard that as success.

Question: At the Open Address symposium it was said that the project would test the hypothesis that "it is possible to build & maintain a sustainable open address database better suited to today's requirements using modern, collaborative approaches to data management". What happens if you fail?

Answer: If we conclude that it is not possible to build a sustainable open address database then we will close down the project and release all source code and data to the community in case others wish to take on the challenge.

Question: How can I be confident that the platform is publishing data which is open data and does not contain any third-party Intellectual Property (IP)? 

Answer: It is vitally important to us that we have open data, that is the guarantee we are making to users. We are publishing the rules that we are using to check whether data contains third-party IP and will be asking all contributors to follow the same rules. We are then tracking provenance throughout all of our systems so that we can remove any data that contains third-party IP when it is discovered.

Question: I think that some of my or my organisation's Intellectual Property has been published through the Open Address Platform? 

Answer: Please [go this page](link to new page). It will show you how to report a copyright infringment.

Question: I have some address data which I want to donate. What do I do next?

Answer: We’d love to receive it but do ensure that you follow the rules and provenance guidelines on the submission forms. These will help us all ensure that there is no third party IP in the file. [This submission page](link to submission form) will show you the rules and how to submit.

Question: Is Open Addresses Limited planning to develop a list of all addresses or provide a list of most addresses?

Answer: Our aim is to provide a definitive list of all addresses but we are realistic. We know that that will not happen overnight. We are developing set of measures for the quality of the address file and will be openly publishing the results as we go.

Question: How do you plan to filter out bad addresses?

Answer: The platform will compare submitted addresses to other open data sources - for example street names and town names - to give a level of confidence to each address. We will publish and finetune the rules for this validation during the Alpha and Beta phases.
