This page contains guidelines for providing datasets to the Open Addresses platform. The guidelines will evolve over time.

We’d love to hear your views on how this guide can be improved. Either make a comment in-line (commenting is open to anyone) or send your suggestion directly to [mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org](info@openaddressesuk.org).

<a name='sourcingdata'>I want to help source a large dataset</a>

Great!

We have set up a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/UXqgc1wy/datasets) to allow people to debate ideas, share the workload, and minimise duplication of effort.

The Trello board allows people to work together on datasets, for example some may be present in each of the UK’s 433 local authorities and hence sourcing the dataset may need 433 Freedom of Information requests to verify whether or not third-party IP is present or 433 visits to different open data platforms to download the data.

The board contains a set of Read Me guidelines to help people along. These will evolve as everyone works together to develop good working practices.

You can choose to participate at different parts of the process based on your skillsets of preference: for example adding ideas, submitting Freedom of Information (FOI) requests or verifying Intellectual Property (IP) rights.

<a name='largedatasets'>What large datasets are useful?</a>

The ideal datasets contain large volumes of UK addresses, are published as open data and are explicitly licenced for reuse.

There are also datasets that are currently closed, probably because they contain a mix of address data and personal data, but where the address part of the dataset could be opened up without creating a privacy violation.  As effort will be required to create a new open dataset from this closed data such datasets will be trickier to source, but these are still potential sources of addresses.

In many cases even if a dataset is published as open data it may not be clear if a dataset contains third-party intellectual property (IP).

Third-party IP cannot be removed from a dataset by the publishing or licensing process. We can only use the data if the IP in the data (including the addresses) is explicitly licensed for reuse - this should occur before the data set is provided to Open Addresses.  Please be sure not to violate others' intellectual property with your submission.

<a name='#thirdpartyIP'>Checking licencing and third party IP</a>


Checking licencing and third party IP can be difficult but it is essential. Some of the law in this area has been untested in court, the Open Government Licence (OGL) and open data publishing process does not guarantee that third-party IP is not present in the dataset.

In our own dataset sourcing activities we have been focussing on whether third party IP was used in producing or maintaining a dataset.

According to the legal opinion that we have received, there are three types of activity that may constitute an infringement:

Copying the entirety, or a subset, of a third-party owned dataset to form the basis of a dataset
Taking an existing list of addresses and correcting them based on information from a third-party owned dataset
Using a third-party owned dataset to add a field containing a linked identifier

If the process by which the dataset is created and maintained is not clear then if the dataset producer is a public sector body the process can be clarified using the Freedom of Information (FOI) process. 

Here are two examples of our team using FOIs to clarify the process by which the Land Registry produce a particular dataset known as Price Paid Data ([one](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/price_paid_dataset_third_party_i) [two](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/price_paid_dataset_followup)). We concluded that this dataset may contain third-party IP.

These FOIs provide some language that others can easily reuse. We would love to hear other’s recommended language so that we can improve this guide.

If the dataset was not produced by a public sector body then it will require discussion with those organisations to determine how the dataset was produced and to gain confidence that no third-party IP is present.

<a name='#submitting'>Submitting data</a>

We will be opening up ways for people to submitting data to the platform during the Beta phase. In the meantime simply add the details to the relevant Trello card or mail us directly at [mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org](info@openaddressesuk.org).

<a href='#infringmenet'>What to do if you believe your IP is being infringed</a>

If we do receive any complaints regarding third-party IP then we will follow our takedown process. It is important to retain any information produced during when sourcing and checking datasets in a public place so that it be used during this process. This allows for a clean and open process.

If you believe your IP is being infringed then at this stage simply email us at [mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org](info@openaddressesuk.org) describing the problem and the data that you believe is affected.
