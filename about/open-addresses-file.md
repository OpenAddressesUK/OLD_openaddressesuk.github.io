title: What is it?
---

The Open Addresses platform will provide a single, definitive national address framework that will ultimately contain all UK addresses and support a unique web identifier for each address. This will make it easy for people to access, link and combine address data with other data. 

We see the Open Addresses file as part of the UK’s National Information Infrastructure and will always make the full dataset available for free as open data.

We will build the address file from open data and crowd­sourced contributions and will ensure that there are no legal barriers to the republishing or reuse of either the address data or any data that is derived from it.

There are existing address files in the UK but all of them leave their users with issues due to either cost, completeness or licence restrictions. Our fundamental commitment to producing a free, definition and open list will allow users to focus on what they want to do; rather than having to think about whether they can afford to or are allowed to.

In addition to the file the Open Address platform will deliver functionality and APIs to consumers and publishers of address to support:

+ the publishing of new addresses, either singly or in bulk
+ the validation and correction of addresses
+ looking up address locations, including their administrative and electoral areas
+ creating lists of addresses within particular areas or with other shared characteristics
