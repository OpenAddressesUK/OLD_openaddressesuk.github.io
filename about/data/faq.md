### Privacy

#### Do Open Addresses create a new privacy risk?

No. We will only be capturing and storing addresses. The addresses where people live are already available through other closed address products. No names, other than those company names that form part of the address, will be associated with addresses.

#### Doesn't Open Addresses mean I'll get more junk mail?

No. If you want to prevent getting junk mail you need to register with the [Mailing Preference Service](http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/mpsr/). Members of the Direct Marketing Association should not send you mail, wherever they get your address from, if you are on that list.

### Organisation

#### How are you funded now?

Our current funding comes from the Cabinet Office’s Release of Data Fund. This fund is administered by the [Open Data User Group](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/open-data-user-group) and agreed by the [Public Sector Transparency Board](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/public-sector-transparency-board). 

#### How long does the funding last and what happens when it runs out ?

Our funding lasts until the end of March 2015. At that point, we will have fully tested the feasibility of the open addresses service and made it sustainable. Part of the work until then will be to explore the different revenue generating options.

#### You state that you are exploring revenue generation options. Will the Open Addresses data really be open data?

The data collected and maintained by Open Addresses will always be available in full, for free, as open data. Open data is information that is available for anyone to use, for any purpose, at no cost.

### Intellectual Property

#### How can I be confident that the platform is publishing data which is open data and does not contain any third-party Intellectual Property (IP)? 

It is vitally important to us that the open data we are publishing is reusable without risk from third party IP claims; that is the guarantee we are making to users. We are publishing the rules that we are using to check whether data contains third-party IP and will be asking all contributors to follow the same rules. We are tracking the source and provenance of data throughout all of our systems so that we can remove any data that contains third-party IP if it is accidentally introduced, as soon as it is discovered.

#### I think that some of my or my organisation's Intellectual Property has been published through the Open Address Platform. How can I remove it?

At this stage, please [email us](mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org) describing the data which you believe is affected.

### Donations

#### I have some address data which I want to donate. What do I do next?

We’d love to receive it! We need to ensure that you follow the rules and provenance guidelines for submissions to ensure that there is no unlicensed third-party IP in the file. Go [here](/about/addingdata) to find out more.

### Quality

#### Is Open Addresses Limited planning to develop a list of all addresses or provide a list of most addresses?

Our aim is to provide a definitive list of all addresses but we are realistic. We know that that will not happen overnight. We are developing sets of measures for the quality of the address list and will be openly publishing the results as we go.

#### How do you plan to filter out bad addresses?

The platform will compare submitted addresses to other open data sources - for example street names and town names - to give a level of confidence to each address. We will publish and fine-tune the rules for this validation during the Beta phase.

#### I've spotted some bad addresses. How do I tell you?

Thanks! Could you head over to our [forums](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum/blob/master/README.md) and leave us a message? We'll work out what we need to do and get it done.

#### How do you plan to maintain the data?

We want to build a community of organisations and people that maintain the data whilst using it. For example just as there is an API to read the data published by the platform we can also receive feedback through the API to add or correct addresses. These feedback loops will help maintain quality and keep the data fresh. We will publish more about this during the Beta phase.

### Future

#### What happens if some other party creates an equivalent open, free product?

If a comparable product is released with a commitment that it will remain free, definitive and open then we would regard that as success.

#### At the Open Address Symposium it was said that the project would test the hypothesis that "it is possible to build & maintain a sustainable open address database better suited to today's requirements using modern, collaborative approaches to data management". What happens if you fail?

If we conclude that it is not possible to build a sustainable open address database then we will close down the project. All the source code and data is published openly, so it could be used again in the future if the environment changes.
