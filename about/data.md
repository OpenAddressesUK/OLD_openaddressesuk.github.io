Open Addresses is a platform that brings together data about the places we live, work and visit. We are creating an open address list for the UK, available for everyone.

We are building the Open Addresses dataset from available open data and from crowd-­sourced contributions. Our aim is ultimately to create a dataset that contains all UK addresses, with a unique web identifier for each one. This will make it easy for people to access, link and combine address data with other data. 

Addresses are a vital part of the UK’s National Information Infrastructure. We will always make the full dataset available for free as open data. We aim to ensure that there are no legal barriers to the republishing or reuse of either the address data or any data that is derived from it.

There are existing address files in the UK but all of them leave their users with issues due to either cost, completeness or licence restrictions. Our fundamental commitment to producing a free, definition and open list will allow users to focus on what they want to do, rather than having to think about whether they can afford to or are allowed to.

In addition to a bulk download, the Open Addresses platform will deliver functionality and APIs to consumers and publishers of address to support:

+ publishing new addresses, either singly or in bulk
+ validating and correcting addresses
+ looking up address locations, including their administrative and electoral areas
+ creating lists of addresses within particular areas or with other shared characteristics
