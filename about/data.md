Open Addresses brings together data about the places we live, work and visit and makes it freely available for everyone.

We are building the Open Addresses list (our “dataset”) from address information that is already available openly on the web and from voluntary contributions by members of the public. All of these contributions go into the same platform that will validate and publish the addresses.

The platform also allows us to track where the addresses came from. UK addresses are part of a very complicated legal puzzle about ownership of different datasets. We want to ensure that the published dataset does not infringe anyone's Intellectual Property (IP) rights.

Our aim is ultimately to publish a dataset that contains all UK addresses, with a unique code (called a “web identifier”) for each one. This will make it easy for people to find, link and combine address data with other data. They might use it for academic research or to provide new services such as making it easier to find a home to rent or buy.

Addresses are a vital part of the UK’s National Information Infrastructure (also known as the NII). We will always make the full dataset available for free as open data. Open data is information that is available for anyone to use, for any purpose, at no cost. We aim to ensure that there are no legal barriers to the republishing or reuse of either the address data or any linked dataset that is derived from it.

Address data is about locations, it is not about people. There will be no personal information attached to the dataset. For example, people will be able to find address information about an individual building but not the people who live or work there. 
There are existing address files in the UK but they tend to charge a fee, require a licence or are incomplete.  Our fundamental commitment to producing a free, open list will allow people to focus on using the data, rather than having to think about whether they can afford to do it, or are allowed to.
People wanting to use our dataset will be able to download the whole list (a “bulk download”). And we will also be developing features that, in time, will enable users to:

+ publish new addresses, either singly or in bulk
+ validate and correcting addresses
+ look up address locations, including their administrative and electoral areas
+ create lists of addresses within particular areas or with other shared characteristics
